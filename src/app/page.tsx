                  franchises spread across major cities in the United States and
                  Canada. Each season, teams compete fiercely for the coveted

His incredible shooting abilities have transformed the game, making him a legend in his own right. Watching Curry sink shots from seemingly impossible angles and distances is a spectacle that few players can match. His impact on the game goes beyond statistics; he has inspired a whole generation of players to emulate his style and work ethic. With multiple NBA championships, MVP awards, and records shattered, Curry's legacy is cemented as one of the greatest players to ever grace the court. His skill, leadership, and influence make him my ultimate choice for the GOAT title in basketball.His accolades include 4 championships, 2 season MVPs, 1 Finals MVP and 10 time ALL Star player and a member of the 75th annual team.</div>
